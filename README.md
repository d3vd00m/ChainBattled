## Dinamic NFTs with On-Chain Metadata
Here we create the basics of a blockchain game by develop a fully dynamic NFT with on-chain metadata that changes based on your interactions with it, and deploy it on Polygon Mumbai to lower gas fees. 

### Interact with the Smart Contract Through Polygon Scan here:
